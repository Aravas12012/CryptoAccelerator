# CryptoAccelerator
The basic  purpose of this project is to implement a SHA-256  function.
Combining a message's bit stream as well as a nonce's we want to find a 256 digest that will contain a specific number of 0s(zeros) in the beginning of the digest in a similar manner as bitcoin is being mined.
